# kiss_simplequeue

A simple, backend-agnostic queue interface for Dart â€” part of the [KISS](https://pub.dev/publishers/your-publisher-name-here) (Keep It Simple, Stupid) family of libraries.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

`kiss_simplequeue` helps you write async, event-based logic without locking into a specific backend. Whether you're using Firebase, AWS SQS, or a custom queue, this library gives you a unified interface with minimal fuss.

Just queues. No ceremony. No complexity.
